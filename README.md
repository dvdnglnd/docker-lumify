# docker-lumify

Lumify containerized

## Status

I have created a set of Dockerfiles that build on each other to load all software needed by Lumify. 

NOTE: The project is not complete. I am working to get the cloudera image to work properly. The namenode process is not starting.

## Build Images

There is one script file to build the many images needed for lumify.

```
./build_image.sh
```

# Run Image

This part is still under development.
